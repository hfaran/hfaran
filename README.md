# hfaran.github.io Content

## Publishing Hugo site to hfaran.github.io

* Adapted from [Host on Github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#github-user-or-organization-pages) article on Hugo documentation
* Run `hugo` in the hugo project folder (`hfaran.github.io\`)
    * This will generate content into the `public` folder which is a submodule to the `hfaran.github.io` repository. Commit and push changes in that repository to deploy to [hfaran.github.io](https://hfaran.github.io)
